ttrss-discord-hook
==================

A fork of [danirod's plugin](https://git.danirod.es/ttrss-discord-webhook.git) for TinyTinyRSS that adds a filter action so that new items received
by feeds can be sent as links to a Discord webhook previously configured in
the settings.

I wanted to use it with a recent TinyTinyRSS version, so I shamelessly copied code from [tt-rss-yourls' plugin](https://github.com/joshp23/tt-rss-yourls/) and pasted it where I could.

According to danirod, this was a very WIP plugin to start with. I didn't improve anything, so use under your own risk.

How to install? Copy the discord_hook directory to your plugins.local/
directory in your TinyTinyRSS install. If you are using Docker builds, you
can also bind the directory or something like that.
